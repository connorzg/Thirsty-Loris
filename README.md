# **Beer Traveler:**
Imagine you're visiting a new city and you're curious what local beer is available. Beer Traveler allows you to browse through a beer list based off your search type. Add beers to the saved list to keep them for future reference and move them over to your tasted list after you've given your beer a try!

# **Technologies Used:**
React Native, Realm

# **Approach to project:**
We used our wireframe as a solid foundation to our project and built on it as we went.

We didn't shy away from using as many components as possible and worked very well as a team of developers and

designers to build a functioning app that provides an informational and user friendly experience.

# **Unsolved problems:**
more than one brewery on location

# **User stories:**
* For the beer lover who is in a different city and wants to know what local beer is available
* When a beer is selected, information that includes the beers name, type, ABV, IBU, and a description
* User is able to place a selected beer into a saved list to try out later
* User can place beers they have tried into a tasted section

* Leave review and rating for tasted beers,
* Animations for landing screen background,
* Beer of the day
